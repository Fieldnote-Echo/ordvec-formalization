# Finite ordered binary decisions

This file contains the combinatorial layer for finite monotone decision rules.
The support is `Fin (n + 1)`, and thresholds are encoded by a cut in
`Fin (n + 2)` so that both degenerate cuts are represented.
-/

/-- The ordered finite support with `n + 1` points. -/
abbrev Support (n : ℕ) := Fin (n + 1)

/-- A strictly positive probability mass function on the finite support. -/
structure PosPMF (n : ℕ) where
  /-- The probability mass at each support point. -/
  mass : Support n → ℝ≥0
  /-- Every support point has strictly positive mass. -/
  pos : ∀ i, 0 < mass i
  /-- The mass function is normalized. -/
  sum_one : Finset.univ.sum mass = 1

/-- A prior probability on `H₁`, bundled with the proof that it is at most one. -/
structure Prior where
  /-- The prior probability of `H₁`. -/
  prob : ℝ≥0
  /-- The prior probability is at most one. -/
  le_one : prob ≤ 1

/--
False-decision costs for deterministic binary admission rules.

`falseAccept` is paid when the rule admits under `H₀`; `falseReject` is paid
when the rule rejects under `H₁`.
-/
structure DecisionCosts where
  /-- Cost of admitting a false candidate under `H₀`. -/
  falseAccept : ℝ≥0
  /-- Cost of rejecting a true candidate under `H₁`. -/
  falseReject : ℝ≥0

The threshold set associated to a cut.

`cut = 0` accepts every support point, while `cut = n + 1` accepts none.
